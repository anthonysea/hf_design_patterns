### Ch. 1
 
Strategy Pattern - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it

### Ch. 2

Observe Pattern - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically
